# Chat Application and Diary Maintenance System

## Overview

This project is a **Chat Application** combined with a **Diary Maintenance System**. It allows users to maintain diary entries while providing a real-time chat feature. The application uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze diary entries and provide emotional feedback, along with a chat system that filters out hateful or offensive messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Transform learning algorithms for mood analysis and advice generation, HateBERT for offensive language detection.

## Features

### Diary Maintenance System
- Users can enter diary entries.
- The system analyzes the mood of the entry (happy, sad, neutral) using transform learning algorithms.
- If the mood is detected as sad, the system provides advice to help normalize the user's mood.

### Chat Application
- Real-time messaging using Socket.io.
- Users can communicate with each other instantly.
- Offensive messages are detected and filtered using HateBERT, blocking users who send hateful content.
